# DLG

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` to :

1. start the dev server
2. start an instance of http-server (which serves the faq.json). 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Running unit tests

Run `ng test`  or `ng test --code-coverage` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).



Note: I am aware of the npm audit vulnerabilities, and will update dependancies as soon as possible
